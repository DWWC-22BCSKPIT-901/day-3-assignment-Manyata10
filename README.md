# DAY 3  

## Questions :  
• Fibonacci Series Using Recursion.   
• Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.  
• You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.  
• Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*' where:  
'?' Matches any single character.  
'*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).  
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
